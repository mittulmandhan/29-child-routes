In angular, some routes may only be view within some particular routes in such scenarios we create child routes.

In our case, we department-detail component and in this component we want to display overview and contact information of the selected department.
Overview and contact information are the features of each department.
so they should be viewable only after navigating to some department component.
We will implement the same in this code.

we can add default child route and even add wildcard child route to manage invalid urls.
Try it out:)
